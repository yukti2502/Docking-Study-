# In-silico Screening of Phytochemicals from Aloe barbadensis and Allium sativum Against Monkeypox Virus A42R Protein

## Overview
This project investigates the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals derived from *Aloe barbadensis* (Aloe vera) and *Allium sativum* (Garlic) against the A42R profilin-like protein of the Monkeypox virus (MPXV) using computational approaches. The study used molecular docking, MM-GBSA binding free energy calculation, and ADME profiling to identify natural compounds with promising antiviral properties.

## Methodology

### 1. Selection and Preparation of Ligands
- 91 phytochemicals were retrieved in 3D SDF format from the IMPPAT database.
- Ligand preparation was performed using LigPrep (Schrödinger Maestro Suite v13.2.138).
- Bond orders were assigned and ionization states generated.

### 2. Protein Preparation
- Target protein A42R profilin-like protein (PDB ID: 4QWO) was downloaded from the PDB.
- Water molecules, hydrogens, and metal ions were removed.
- Bond orders were assigned using the Protein Preparation Wizard.

### 3. Binding Site Prediction and Grid Generation
- SiteMap module was used to predict the binding site due to lack of known binding site.
- Sites with score > 0.9 were selected. Best site score: 1.004
- Grid box dimensions: 20 x 20 x 20 Å centered on Site 1.

### 4. Molecular Docking (Glide SP)
- All 91 ligands were docked using Glide’s Standard Precision (SP) mode.
- 14 compounds showed high binding affinity.

### 5. MM-GBSA Analysis
- MM-GBSA (via Prime) calculated free binding energy using 5 Å residue distance.
- Binding energies ranged from −35 to −18 kcal/mol, confirming stability.

### 6. In-silico ADME Profiling
- Top compounds analyzed using QikProp for ADME properties.
- Lipinski’s Rule of Five, QPlogS, QPlogBB, and %Human Oral Absorption evaluated.
